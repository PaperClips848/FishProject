# FishProject

### Identifying and Documenting Environmental Correlations in Fish Data Across Northeast Texas and Southeast Oklahoma

---

## Project Overview

**FishProject** explores relationships between environmental attributes and fish community metrics — such as total population and species richness — using combined **MATLAB** and **Python** analysis workflows.

The goal is to identify environmental and ecological factors that most influence fish community composition and to visualize these patterns clearly through reproducible, data-driven plots and models.

## Key Objectives

- Quantify correlations between fish abundance/species richness and environmental variables.  
- Visualize complex relationships using **Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib)** and **MATLAB** scripts.  
- Identify outliers and unusual site behavior.  
- Develop reproducible workflows and maintain clear, editable documentation for future contributors.
